# Chess Game

For contribute to the Chess Game you need to Fork this repository on you machine and have installed node[https://nodejs.org/en/download/].
Then you need to run `npm run install`.
After installing all the dependencies, you can run `npm run dev`, that will server you application usually on `localhost:8080/`.
So now you can make your changes and make a Merge Request so I can evaluate the changes that you made and merge then into master. It's recommended that you use a different branch like `feature/nameOfYouFeature` and make `semantic commits`.
